ToDo-List:

-> Write ReadMe to explain basic things like:
    - how to train the model
    - how to look at results:
        - open mlflow
        - 
-> Reference Training dataset 
1. Implement inference/deployment
1. Write tests for model and other code
2. Set-up github-repo
3. Set-up Tracking Server for MLFlow
4. 

















Certainly! Here's a combined list of actions in chronological order for implementing your MLOps pipeline:

    Data Collection and Version Control:
        Collect and curate your dataset.
        Use DVC for data version control to track changes to your dataset.
        Store your data in a versioned and organized manner.

    Code Version Control:
        Set up a Git repository to track changes in your codebase.
        Use branching and versioning for code changes.

    Data Preprocessing and Augmentation:
        Implement data preprocessing and augmentation as necessary for your image classification task.
        Ensure that data preprocessing steps are well-documented and reproducible.

    Hyperparameter Tuning:
        Use Hydra to manage hyperparameters effectively.

    Model Training:
        Train your image classification model using PyTorch Lightning.
        Log hyperparameters, metrics, and model artifacts using MLflow.

    Data Splitting and Validation:
        Split your data into training, validation, and testing datasets.
        Implement cross-validation or other validation techniques as needed.

    Experiment Tracking:
        Continuously log experiment information, including hyperparameters and metrics, using MLflow.

    Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
        Set up CI/CD pipelines to trigger model training and deployment automatically upon code and data updates.
        Use tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD for automation.

    Testing and Quality Assurance:
        Implement unit tests, integration tests, and model evaluation tests to ensure code and model quality.

    Monitoring and Alerting:
        Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect model performance degradation or drift in production.
        Consider tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

    Security and Privacy:
        Implement security measures to protect data and model access.
        Ensure compliance with privacy requirements if applicable.

    Scaling and Efficiency:
        Plan for scaling your training and deployment processes efficiently as your model and dataset grow.
        Consider distributed training and containerization.

    Documentation:
        Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for your pipeline, including setup instructions and best practices.

    Version Control for Data:
        Continue using DVC to version control data changes effectively.

    Model Monitoring and Retraining:
        Implement automatic model retraining when performance metrics degrade beyond a predefined threshold.
        Monitor for data drift.

    Robust Deployment Strategies:
        Choose a robust strategy for deploying and serving your model (e.g., containerization with Docker or orchestration with Kubernetes).

    Rollback Strategy:
        Plan and document procedures for rolling back to previous model versions in case of issues in production.

    Cost Monitoring:
        Keep an eye on the cost associated with running your pipeline, especially in a cloud environment.
        Implement cost monitoring and optimization practices.

    Compliance and Governance:
        Ensure that your pipeline complies with relevant regulations and governance policies, if applicable.

Remember that this is a comprehensive list, and the implementation of each step may vary based on your specific project requirements and constraints. Continuously iterate and improve your MLOps pipeline to adapt to changing needs and technologies.
